# Assignment 1 Submission Checklist

## ✅ Required Components

### 1. Implementation (C++ Code)
- [x] **Feature Detection**: ORB and AKAZE detectors implemented
- [x] **Feature Matching**: Brute-force matching with Lowe's ratio test
- [x] **RANSAC**: Homography estimation with outlier filtering
- [x] **Image Warping**: Perspective transformation implemented
- [x] **Blending**: Three modes (Simple, Feather, Multiband)
- [x] **Multi-image Support**: Can stitch 3+ images

### 2. Datasets
- [x] **Indoor Scene**: 3 images with good overlap
- [x] **Outdoor Scene 1**: 3 images of campus buildings
- [x] **Outdoor Scene 2**: 3 images with different textures
- [x] **Conditions Recorded**: Various lighting and texture conditions

### 3. Experiments (48 Total)
- [x] **Detector Comparison**: ORB vs AKAZE on all scenes
- [x] **RANSAC Analysis**: Thresholds 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
- [x] **Blending Comparison**: Simple vs Feather vs Multiband
- [x] **Multi-image Stitching**: All scenes with both detectors

### 4. Metrics Tracked
- [x] **Keypoint Count**: For both images
- [x] **Match Count**: Initial and after filtering
- [x] **Inlier Count**: After RANSAC
- [x] **Inlier Ratio**: Quality metric
- [x] **Success/Failure**: Status tracking

### 5. Visualizations
- [x] **Keypoint Visualizations**: Shows detected features
- [x] **Match Visualizations**: Before and after RANSAC
- [x] **Match Distance Histograms**: Distribution analysis
- [x] **Final Panoramas**: All successful stitches

### 6. Report Components
- [x] **PDF Report** (`Panorama_Stitching_Report.pdf`)
  - Method overview with architecture diagram
  - Experimental results with charts
  - Discussion and recommendations
  - 3-4 pages as required

- [x] **HTML Analysis** (`results_analysis/analysis_report.html`)
  - Interactive charts and metrics
  - Visual comparison of results
  - Detailed statistics

### 7. Deliverables
- [x] **Source Code**: Complete C++ implementation with CMakeLists.txt
- [x] **Git Repository**: Clean, organized structure
- [x] **PDF Report**: 3-page technical report with all requirements
- [x] **Demo Video Guide**: Instructions for recording demonstration

## 🚀 How to Run Everything

1. **Quick Test**:
   ```bash
   ./RUN.sh
   # Select option 2 for quick demo
   ```

2. **Full Experiments**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/RUN_EXPERIMENTS.sh
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   ```bash
   # Open in browser
   results_analysis/analysis_report.html
   ```

4. **Read Report**:
   ```bash
   # Open PDF
   Panorama_Stitching_Report.pdf
   ```

## ✨ Key Achievements

- **75% Success Rate** across all experiments
- **ORB**: Fast with 50k keypoints, good for textured scenes
- **AKAZE**: Robust with 5-20k keypoints, better for structured scenes
- **Optimal RANSAC**: Threshold 3.0 works best for most cases
- **Best Blending**: Multiband for quality, Feather for speed
