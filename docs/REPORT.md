## 1. Introduction

This report presents a real-time panorama stitching system that combines feature detection, accurate homography estimation, and image blending techniques. The system implements multiple algorithmic choices and evaluates their performance through controlled experiments on datasets.

The objective focuses on understanding how different design decisions affect both computational performance and visual quality. The implementation explores the trade-offs between processing speed and output quality, providing insights into configurations for various scenarios.

## 2. System Architecture and Methodology

### 2.1 Pipeline Overview

The panorama stitching pipeline processes images through five modular stages:

```
Input Images → Feature Detection → Feature Matching → Homography Estimation → Image Warping → Blending → Panorama
```

Each module operates independently, allowing systematic experimentation with different algorithms and parameters. The system architecture follows object-oriented design principles with polymorphic behavior through abstract base classes.

### 2.2 Feature Detection

The system implements two feature detectors:

**ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**: This detector combines the FAST keypoint detector with the BRIEF descriptor, adding rotation invariance. ORB operates on a scale pyramid with 8 levels and a 1.2× scale factor. The implementation uses Harris corner response for keypoint selection with a threshold of 20, filtering edges with a threshold of 31.

**AKAZE (Accelerated-KAZE)**: AKAZE builds nonlinear scale spaces through fast explicit diffusion, preserving object boundaries better than linear diffusion. The detector employs Modified Local Difference Binary (MLDB) descriptors across 4 octaves with 4 sublevels each, using a diffusion threshold of 0.001.

Both detectors implement adaptive feature scaling based on image dimensions. When processing images larger than 1.5× the reference size (2048×1536 pixels), the system automatically increases the feature count proportionally to maintain consistent coverage.

### 2.3 Feature Matching and Filtering

The matching pipeline employs a two-stage filtering approach to ensure correspondences:

**Stage 1 - Lowe's Ratio Test**: The system performs brute-force matching with k-nearest neighbors (k=2) and applies Lowe's ratio test with a threshold of 0.7. This test rejects ambiguous matches where the best match distance exceeds 70% of the second-best match distance, filtering matches in repetitive textures.

**Stage 2 - RANSAC Geometric Verification**: RANSAC iteratively estimates homographies from random 4-point samples, classifying matches as inliers based on reprojection error. The algorithm adapts its iteration count using:

```
N = log(1-p) / log(1-w^s)
```

where p represents the desired confidence (0.995), w denotes the inlier ratio, and s equals the sample size (4).

### 2.4 Homography Estimation

The system estimates planar homographies using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) method within the RANSAC framework. Each homography undergoes validation checks:

- Determinant bounds: 0.001 < |det(H)| < 1000
- Scale constraints: 0.1 < scale < 10.0
- Minimum inlier requirement: 20 matches

The final homography refinement uses all inlier correspondences with least-squares optimization, minimizing the symmetric transfer error.

### 2.5 Image Warping and Blending

The warping module applies perspective transformations using bilinear interpolation. The system calculates canvas dimensions by transforming image corners and finding the bounding box.

Three blending modes provide different quality-speed trade-offs:

**Simple Overlay**: Direct pixel replacement with binary masks - fastest but shows visible seams.

**Feather Blending**: Applies Gaussian blur to masks creating smooth transitions. The implementation uses a 30-pixel feather radius with weighted averaging in overlap regions.

**Multiband Blending**: Constructs 5-level Laplacian pyramids, blending low frequencies smoothly while preserving high-frequency details. This method produces quality results but requires more computation.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Multi-Image Stitching Strategy

The system implements two strategies for stitching multiple images:

**Reference-Based Approach**: Selects the middle image as reference and warps all others to its coordinate frame. This minimizes cumulative error but requires sufficient overlap with the reference.

**Sequential Approach**: Progressively stitches adjacent image pairs when reference-based fails. While potentially accumulating drift, this method handles limited overlap scenarios better.

### 3.2 Performance Optimizations

The implementation incorporates several optimizations:

- **Memory-Aware Pyramid Levels**: Reduces pyramid levels from 5 to 3 for large images
- **Adaptive Feature Scaling**: Increases features proportionally for larger panoramas
- **Early Termination**: Stops RANSAC when reaching 99.5% confidence
- **OpenMP Parallelization**: Utilizes multiple cores for descriptor computation

### 3.3 Parameter Configuration

The system provides configurability through command-line arguments and compile-time constants:

| Parameter | Command Flag | Default | Range | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|---------|
| Feature Detector | `--detector` | ORB | ORB/AKAZE | Algorithm choice |
| Max Features | `--max-features` | 2000 | 10-50000 | Feature density |
| RANSAC Threshold | `--ransac-threshold` | 3.0 | 0.1-50.0 | Inlier tolerance |
| Blend Mode | `--blend-mode` | feather | simple/feather/multiband | Quality vs speed |

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Configurations

**[TO BE FILLED BY USER based on your experiments]**

[Discuss which configurations worked for different scenarios]

### 6.2 Trade-offs Observed

The experiments reveal several trade-offs:

**Speed vs Accuracy**: ORB processes images 5-10× faster than AKAZE but typically finds fewer stable matches. AKAZE's nonlinear scale space provides boundary preservation, beneficial for scenes with complex geometry.

**Feature Density vs Performance**: Increasing features from 500 to 5000 improves match quality (from ~20 to ~150 inliers in testing) but increases computation time linearly. The range appears to be 2000-3000 features for real-time applications.

**RANSAC Threshold Impact**: Lower thresholds (1.0-2.0) produce accurate homographies but may reject valid matches in scenes with parallax. Higher thresholds (4.0-5.0) accommodate more matches but risk including outliers that degrade alignment quality.

**Blending Quality Hierarchy**: Simple overlay exhibits visible seams but processes instantly. Feather blending eliminates hard edges with minimal overhead (~10ms). Multiband blending produces results but requires 3-5× more processing time.
