# Kevin's Remaining Tasks for Assignment Completion

## âœ… What I've Completed for You

1. **Updated Report with Your Info**
   - Added your name: Kevin Phan
   - Added hardware specs: RTX 4050 laptop, Intel CPU, 16GB RAM
   - Set up Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2) environment details

2. **Ran All Experiments**
   - Tested ORB vs AKAZE detectors
   - Analyzed RANSAC thresholds (1.0 to 5.0)
   - Compared blending modes (simple, feather, multiband)
   - Tested different feature counts (500, 1000, 2000, 5000)
   - Generated panoramas for all scenes

3. **Filled Report with Quantitative Data**
   - Feature detector comparison table with metrics
   - RANSAC threshold analysis with inlier counts
   - Feature count performance analysis
   - Scene success rates (100% for all test scenes)
   - Three data-driven conclusions

## ðŸ”´ What You MUST Do (Critical)

### 1. Subjective Visual Evaluation (20 minutes)
You need to LOOK at the images and write your observations!

**Compare blending modes visually:**
```bash
# View the three blending outputs
eog results/indoor_simple.jpg results/indoor_feather.jpg results/indoor_multiband.jpg

# Or use any image viewer
display results/indoor_*.jpg
```

**Fill in Section 5.3** with observations like:
```markdown
### 5.3 Blending Method Evaluation

Visual inspection of the three blending modes reveals:
- **Simple overlay**: Visible hard seams at image boundaries (rate: 8/10 visibility), 
  abrupt color transitions, no gradual blending
- **Feather blending**: Smooth transitions with no visible seams (rate: 1/10), 
  slight color bleeding in overlap regions but overall natural appearance
- **Multiband blending**: Seamless blending (rate: 0/10), excellent detail preservation,
  best color consistency across boundaries, highest visual quality
```

### 2. Add Visual Quality Assessments
**Section 5.4** needs match visualization description:
```markdown
### 5.4 Match Distance Distribution

The histogram of match distances shows [describe what you see]:
- Most matches cluster around distance values of [X-Y]
- Distribution is [normal/skewed/bimodal]
- Outliers appear at distances above [Z]
```

### 3. Document Any Failures (Section 6.3)
Run these tests and document what happens:
```bash
# Try stitching non-adjacent images (likely to fail)
./build/panorama_stitcher --stitch datasets/indoor_scene/img1.jpg datasets/indoor_scene/img3.jpg --output test_fail.jpg

# Document the failure
```

Write in Section 6.3:
```markdown
### 6.3 Failure Cases and Limitations

During experimentation, the following failure cases were observed:
- Non-adjacent images (img1 + img3) failed due to insufficient overlap (<10%)
- [Any other failures you notice]
```

### 4. Record Demo Video (10 minutes)
Create a 1-2 minute screen recording showing:

```bash
# Start recording (use SimpleScreenRecorder or OBS)
# Then run:
./scripts/run_panorama.sh --stitch datasets/indoor_scene/img1.jpg datasets/indoor_scene/img2.jpg --visualize --output demo_result.jpg

# Show the result
eog demo_result.jpg
```

Save as `demo_video.mp4` or similar.

### 5. Generate Final PDF (2 minutes)
After completing above tasks:
```bash
# Install pandoc if needed
sudo apt-get install pandoc texlive-latex-base

# Generate PDF
./scripts/compile_report.sh

# Check the output
evince docs/REPORT.pdf  # or any PDF viewer
```

## ðŸŸ¡ Optional But Recommended

### Take Real Outdoor Photos (30 minutes)
Replace the temporary outdoor images:
1. Go outside, take 2 sets of 3 photos each
2. Save to `datasets/outdoor_scene1/` and `datasets/outdoor_scene2/`
3. Re-run experiments: `./scripts/run_report_experiments.sh`
4. Update report with new results

### Add Screenshots to Report
Insert actual images in the report:
```markdown
![Detector Comparison](results/indoor_orb.jpg)
![RANSAC Analysis](results/indoor_ransac_3.0.jpg)
![Blending Comparison](results/indoor_multiband.jpg)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Final Submission Checklist

- [ ] Subjective visual quality assessment written (Section 5.3)
- [ ] Match distance distribution described (Section 5.4) 
- [ ] Failure cases documented (Section 6.3)
- [ ] Demo video recorded (1-2 minutes)
- [ ] PDF report generated (3-4 pages)
- [ ] Optional: Real outdoor photos taken and tested

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# View all generated panoramas
ls -la results/*.jpg

# Compare blending modes side by side
eog results/indoor_simple.jpg results/indoor_feather.jpg results/indoor_multiband.jpg &

# Generate PDF report
./scripts/compile_report.sh

# Test a specific configuration
./build/panorama_stitcher --stitch img1.jpg img2.jpg --detector akaze --blend-mode multiband --visualize --output test.jpg
```

## Time Estimate
- **Required tasks**: 30-40 minutes
- **With real photos**: 60-70 minutes

The code is complete and all quantitative analysis is done. You just need to add the human visual assessment and record the demo!
