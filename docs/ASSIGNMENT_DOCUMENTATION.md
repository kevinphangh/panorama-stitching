## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 System Architecture

#### 3.1.1 Pipeline Overview

The panorama stitching pipeline consists of five sequential stages. First, feature detection identifies distinctive keypoints in each image. Next, feature matching establishes correspondences between keypoint descriptors across images. The third stage employs RANSAC to compute a robust homography transformation from these matches. Image warping then projects all images into a common coordinate frame using this homography. Finally, image blending combines the warped images seamlessly to produce the panorama.

#### 3.1.2 Implementation Structure

The system is implemented in C++ using OpenCV 4.x with a modular architecture. Feature detection modules provide both ORB and AKAZE detectors, while the matching module implements brute-force matching with Lowe's ratio test filtering. The RANSAC-based homography estimator handles geometric transformation computation, and the perspective warper performs planar projection. Three distinct blending algorithms (simple overlay, feathering, and multiband) offer different quality-performance trade-offs.

### 3.2 Feature Detection

#### 3.2.1 ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

ORB combines the FAST keypoint detector with the BRIEF descriptor, adding rotation invariance. Our implementation configures ORB with a maximum of 50,000 features that adapt based on image size, using a scale factor of 1.2 between pyramid levels across 8 levels total. An edge threshold of 31 pixels prevents keypoints near image boundaries, while Harris scoring ranks keypoints by corner response quality. ORB uses 256-bit binary descriptors, enabling fast Hamming distance computation during matching. The high feature count ensures adequate coverage for large panoramas while maintaining computational efficiency.

#### 3.2.2 AKAZE (Accelerated-KAZE)

AKAZE builds on KAZE features using Fast Explicit Diffusion (FED) for nonlinear scale space construction. The implementation uses M-LDB (Modified Local Difference Binary) descriptors of 256 bits with a detection threshold of 0.001f. The scale space comprises 4 octaves with 4 layers each, providing robust multi-scale feature detection. AKAZE provides better invariance to scale and rotation than ORB, though with higher computational cost. It excels in scenes with blur or significant viewpoint changes, making it particularly suitable for challenging indoor environments.

### 3.3 Feature Matching

#### 3.3.1 Descriptor Matching

We employ brute-force matching with k-nearest neighbors (k=2) to find the two best matches for each descriptor. Both ORB and AKAZE use Hamming distance as their metric since they produce binary descriptors, enabling efficient bitwise XOR operations for distance computation.

#### 3.3.2 Lowe's Ratio Test

To filter ambiguous matches, we apply Lowe's ratio test with threshold 0.7:

```
if (distance_to_best_match / distance_to_second_best < 0.7)
    accept match
else
    reject as ambiguous
```

This test effectively removes matches where multiple similar descriptors exist, reducing false positives. The 0.7 threshold balances between retaining good matches and filtering outliers.

### 3.4 Robust Homography Estimation

#### 3.4.1 RANSAC Algorithm

Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) robustly estimates the homography matrix despite outliers in matches. The algorithm iteratively samples minimal sets of four point correspondences to compute candidate homographies using Direct Linear Transform (DLT). For each candidate, it counts inliers as points with reprojection error below the threshold. This process continues for up to 2000 iterations or until the desired confidence level is reached. Once the best model is found, all inliers are used to compute a refined homography for improved accuracy.

#### 3.4.2 Reprojection Threshold

The reprojection threshold determines inlier classification. For a point p‚ÇÅ in image 1 with match p‚ÇÇ in image 2:

```
error = ||Hp‚ÇÅ - p‚ÇÇ||‚ÇÇ
if error < threshold (3.0 pixels default)
    mark as inlier
```

We test thresholds from 1.0 to 5.0 pixels to analyze the trade-off between precision and recall.

#### 3.4.3 Adaptive Iteration

The number of RANSAC iterations adapts based on inlier ratio:

```
N = log(1 - p) / log(1 - w‚Å¥)
where:
  p = desired confidence (0.995)
  w = inlier ratio observed
```

This reduces computation when many inliers are found early.

### 3.5 Image Warping

#### 3.5.1 Planar Projection

We use perspective (planar) projection via 3√ó3 homography transformation:

```
[x']   [h‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ h‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ] [x]
[y'] = [h‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ h‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ] [y]
[w']   [h‚ÇÉ‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ h‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ] [1]

x_normalized = x'/w'
y_normalized = y'/w'
```

This assumes the scene is approximately planar or the camera motion is primarily rotational. While this limitation causes distortion in wide field-of-view panoramas (>120¬∞), it provides computational efficiency and mathematical simplicity.

#### 3.5.2 Output Bounds Calculation

To determine panorama dimensions, we first transform all image corners using the computed homography. The bounding box of these transformed corners defines the output size. A translation matrix shifts the coordinate system to ensure all values remain positive, and a 10-pixel padding is added around the edges to accommodate blending operations without boundary artifacts.

### 3.6 Image Blending

#### 3.6.1 Simple Overlay

Direct pixel replacement where the second image overwrites the first in overlapping regions. Fast but produces visible seams.

#### 3.6.2 Feathering (Linear Blending)

Weight-based blending using distance transforms:

```
weight‚ÇÅ = distance_from_edge(mask‚ÇÅ) / feather_radius
weight‚ÇÇ = distance_from_edge(mask‚ÇÇ) / feather_radius
pixel_out = (pixel‚ÇÅ √ó weight‚ÇÅ + pixel‚ÇÇ √ó weight‚ÇÇ) / (weight‚ÇÅ + weight‚ÇÇ)
```

The feather radius (default 30 pixels) controls the transition width. This method reduces seams but may cause ghosting with misalignment.

#### 3.6.3 Multiband Blending

Multiband blending uses Laplacian pyramid decomposition to blend different frequency bands separately. The algorithm first builds Gaussian pyramids G‚ÇÅ and G‚ÇÇ for both input images, then computes Laplacian pyramids where each level L·µ¢ = G·µ¢ - G·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ represents a frequency band. A mask pyramid provides smooth weight transitions across scales. At each pyramid level, blending combines the bands using L‚Çí·µ§‚Çú = L‚ÇÅ √ó mask + L‚ÇÇ √ó (1-mask). Finally, the blended pyramid is reconstructed to produce the output image. This approach ensures low frequencies blend smoothly to hide seams while high-frequency details preserve sharpness. Our implementation uses 5 pyramid levels by default, with automatic reduction for memory-constrained scenarios.

### 3.7 Multi-Image Stitching

For panoramas with more than two images, we employ sequential pairwise stitching. The first two images are stitched to create an intermediate result, which then serves as the base for stitching the third image. This process continues sequentially for all remaining images. While this approach can accumulate alignment errors through the chain, it provides computational efficiency compared to global optimization methods and remains practical for small to medium image sets.

### 3.8 Implementation Details

#### 3.8.1 Memory Management

The system enforces strict memory limits to prevent system instability, capping individual images at 100 megapixels and total panorama memory at 2GB. Dynamic allocation handles large matrices efficiently, while smart pointers ensure automatic cleanup and prevent memory leaks throughout the pipeline.

#### 3.8.2 Error Handling

Robust validation prevents degenerate cases at multiple stages. Homography matrices are validated to have determinants between 0.001 and 1000, preventing singular or extreme transformations. Scale factors are constrained between 0.1√ó and 10√ó to avoid excessive distortion. A minimum of 20 inlier matches is required for reliable homography estimation. All transformation results undergo NaN and infinity checking to catch numerical instabilities early.

#### 3.8.3 Optimization

Several optimizations improve performance without sacrificing quality. OpenMP parallelization accelerates feature detection across multiple CPU cores. RANSAC terminates early when a high inlier ratio indicates a good model has been found. Distance transforms are cached during feathering to avoid redundant computation. Integral images enable efficient filtering operations with constant-time pixel summation.

## 5. Methodology & Results

### 5.1 Experimental Design

#### 5.1.1 Parameter Space

Our experiments systematically explore the parameter space across four dimensions. We compare ORB and AKAZE detectors to understand their relative strengths. RANSAC thresholds are varied from 1.0 to 5.0 pixels in unit increments to analyze the precision-recall trade-off. Three blending modes (simple overlay, feathering, and multiband) are tested to evaluate quality versus computational cost. These configurations are tested on three distinct scenes: an indoor environment with structured geometry, and two outdoor scenes with varying texture complexity.

#### 5.1.2 Metrics Collected

Each experiment records comprehensive metrics to enable thorough analysis. We track keypoint counts for both images, the number of initial matches after ratio test filtering, and the final inlier count and ratio after RANSAC refinement. Computation time is measured for each pipeline stage to identify bottlenecks. The system also records success/failure status and average reprojection error for quality assessment.

#### 5.1.3 Adaptive Features

Feature count scales with image resolution:

```
adaptive_features = base_features √ó sqrt(image_pixels / reference_pixels)
reference = 2048 √ó 1536 pixels
```

This ensures consistent feature density across different image sizes.

### 5.2 Limitations and Future Work

#### 5.2.1 Current Limitations

The current implementation has several notable limitations. The planar projection assumption causes increasing distortion as field of view exceeds 120 degrees, making it unsuitable for very wide panoramas. Sequential stitching accumulates alignment errors through the image chain, potentially degrading quality in large multi-image sets. The system assumes a fixed focal length without automatic calibration, requiring manual parameter tuning for different cameras. Finally, the lack of cylindrical or spherical projection options limits applicability to wide-angle scenarios.

#### 5.2.2 Potential Improvements

Future enhancements could address these limitations through several approaches. Implementing cylindrical warping would better handle wide panoramas with primarily rotational camera motion. Bundle adjustment could provide global optimization across all images simultaneously, reducing accumulated errors. Automatic exposure compensation would improve appearance consistency across varying lighting conditions. GPU acceleration using CUDA or OpenCL could enable real-time performance for interactive applications. Finally, graph-cut optimization for seam placement could further reduce visible artifacts in challenging overlap regions.

### 5.3 Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete panorama stitching pipeline with extensive parameterization for experimental analysis. By implementing core algorithms while leveraging OpenCV's mathematical primitives, we achieve a balance between educational value and practical performance. The modular architecture facilitates testing different configurations and understanding the impact of each component on final panorama quality.
